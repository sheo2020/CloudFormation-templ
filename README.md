1. File "SG-NameThroughParameter.yaml" is giving an example on how to take User Input and use that as AWS resource name. In this through the "Parameter" section I have asked the user to write the name of the Security Group and have created the Security Group with the Name given by the user.

2. vpc-subnet-sg-ecc-disk-intgtway-natgatway-templ-designer.yaml
CloudFormation Template for automatic provisioning of VPC with 2 Subnets (APP & DB), 3 Security Groups (SSH, ICMP, HTTP and SQL Port Ingress), 2 EC2 Instances with Security Groups, 2 Additional Volumes, 1 Internet Gateway, 1 Nat Gateway in APP Subnet and Route to Internet for DB through Nat Gateway.

Note: You will be billed for the AWS resources used if you create a stack from this template.
